# ShogunEra
A mod about Japanese weapons featuring katanas, daggers, maces, spears, armors, and more.

- The weapons are balanced with a sense of progression; however, I haven't yet created a proper config file for users to tweak them as they like.
- This is my first mod, so it might have a few bugs :c. I'm learning as I go.
- Itâ€™s part of a larger mod that adds a wide variety of themed weapons for use on the Chaos Heim server.
- You can find me on our Valheim server's Discord. My name is **Azathoth** or **Hershel the Farmer** in OdinPlus.
- Feel free to send suggestions for balancing weapons or adding more Japanese-themed items.
- Recommended to use alongside **Golden Jude's Blacksmith Tools** for proper armor visuals.
