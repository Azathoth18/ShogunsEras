# ShogunEra
A mod about japanese weapons, there are katanas, daggers, maces, spears, among others.
-The weapons are unbalanced, and the idea is that each person can configure them as they see fit. 
-It's my first mod, so it may contain some mistakes :c, also I'm in a constant learning process.
-It's part of a bigger mod that will add a lot of theme weapons to be used in the Chaos Heim server. 
-You can look for me on the discord of our valheim server, my name is Azathoth or as Hershel the farmer on OdinPLus.
-Suggestions for rebalancing weapons as well as adding new Japanese themed weapons are welcome.

 
## Credits
* First of all, this would not be possible without the help of my great mentor Valkyrie or quantumperception creator of great mods, I can't thank you enough for all the time you took to answer my many doubts and questions, no matter how stupid they were.
* Also thanks to Midnightsfx creator of valheim armory and Valheim Fortres, for answering all my stupid and continuous questions at any time and supporting me at times when I wanted to throw it all away.
* Thanks to Metra, my partner and I feel him as a great friend I have met in the world of valheim, the best pvp player and balance genius of valheim.
* Thanks to Ono,Niu (Thanks for icon) geniuses of building in valheim, for their support
* Also to my girlfriend, for putting up with my moments of obsession with the game and the desire to learn more and more.
* Finally my thanks may seem exaggerated, but it's really something I've been wanting to learn for a long time and if it wasn't for these people none of this would be possible.
